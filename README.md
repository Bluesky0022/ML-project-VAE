# ML-project-VAE

The goal of this project is to generate new samples of images through a variational auto-encoder. We can use this model to generate new data from latent space. The latent space is assumed multi-variant Gaussian. The data set is MNIST.

I also added an implemention of conditional VAE, which enables output specific digital numbers.
